# Minimalistic Timelog — One‑Click GitHub Pages

**You don't need to type commands.** Just do this:

1. Create a new repo on GitHub named **minimalistic-timelog** (or any name).
2. Upload **everything in this folder** to that repo (including the `.github/workflows/pages.yml` file).
3. Go to **Actions** tab → click **I understand** → a workflow named *Deploy to GitHub Pages (Vite)* will run.
4. When it finishes (green check), open **Settings → Pages**. Your site URL will be shown there.

> The site will be at `https://<yourusername>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
